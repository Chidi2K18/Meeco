# Meeco

Project Goal:
In a group of 4, we created an application to promote sustainable choices among users. Starting from scratch, we developed the project through idea generation, refinement, execution, and publication stages.

This project:
At Meeco we developed an application for all your sustainable shopping needs. In the app we rate different brands based on their environmental impact in terms of how they produce their products. All this is done in an effort to help consumers drive sustainable decisions.

Tech Stack used:
React Native
Html5
CSS6/Bootstrap
Javascript/JSX

Unfortunately the project was made private by the team member that initialised the repository, but I can talk about my contributions towards it:
* I worked on the affiliate and shop profile pages.
* This was tasked with developing the front end for these pages using HTML,CSS and react native script to create an interactive user experience. I made use of react native     elements e.g. views(safe area, scroll, etc.), modals, pressables to name a few.
* along with stying these pages to fit the designs produced by our designer and create a cohesive experience.
